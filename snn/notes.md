##  Data
- BBBP / Cider - [x]
- Fingerprints - [x] (added +2) - Testing required
- Calcular Shannon entropy to quantify how unbalanced a dataset is - []

## Network
- Metrics - [x]
- Weights - [x] (added, need results)
- Early Stopping - []

## Hyperparameters
- Epochs
- Leavy vs Synaptic
- Beta value (membrane decay)
- Morgan vs MACCS vs RDKitFP
- class_weights vs None
- rate vs temporal encoding
- Backpropagation dS/dU alternatives (default = ATan)
- learnable threshold (may not be necessary)

-> Move random_split in to the for loop - [x]
-> Explainability (Track the spikes backwards, use MACCS (smaller -> easier))

snnTorch use mem_rec to calculate loss (just the first tutorial) -> ver
